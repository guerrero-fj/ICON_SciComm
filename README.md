# ICON_SciComm
We will use this public repository to document our Communication Infrastructure Building Process at PNNL. ICON is a set of designing principles for science including: Integration, Coordination, Openness, and Networkin. By Communication infrastructure we refer to the integration of "soft" and "hard" approaches to facilitate Team Science and to catalyze discovery and engagement.
